# Physical-Human-Robot-Interaction-Lab
Lab files from Physical Human Robot Interaction, using mostly LabVIEW for data acquisition, processing, and control(online), and MATLAB for data processing(offline).

In the lab, we performed several tasks prepared for the final project, including sensor and actuator characterization, online/offline signal filtering in LabVIEW/MATLAB, modelling and PID control of the ETHZ Haptic Paddle, modelling of friction and gravity, and impedance control of the ETHZ Haptic Paddle to generate virtual wall.

Our final project was to compare the transparency under different control scheme, namely open-loop impedance control, impedance control with model feed-forward, and impedance control with force feedback.
